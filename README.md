Fish Tank Guy: A Platform for Aquarium Cleaning Services
Fish Tank Guy is an online platform designed to offer a wide range of services to the public on behalf of an aquarium cleaning business. Our mission is to provide high-quality website platforms to service providers of all types. Our website and business model were chosen for their uniqueness and visual effect, making it an effective way to advertise aquarium cleaning services.
UX: Pre-Project Planning
To create a website that meets the needs of our client's customers, we started by identifying the purpose of this project. Our goal was to develop the skills required to provide a website for a client or employer that meets their needs. Selling a service to clean aquaria or selling fish and fish tanks online is similar in design and functionality to selling most other services and products. By providing a site that is functionally easy to use and presents the services and products on offer in a visually attractive manner, we are meeting customer needs and providing an enjoyable experience.
Our team includes avid aquarium enthusiasts who recognized a gap in the market for aquarium cleaning services in Dublin. We decided to build this platform to advertise the services of a professional cleaner and provide a unique online experience for aquarium owners. Fish Tank Guy meets the needs of its target audience, which includes fish enthusiasts, those with accessibility issues who are fish owners and require one of these services, and clients that want similar functionality, visual effects, and customer experience for their own website.

Colours:
We drew our palette from the background image, which features calming and pleasing colours that regularly trend on coolors.co. Our palette includes navy, dark blue, sky blue, yellow, and turquoise/aqua marine. https://coolors.co/palettes/trending
Images:
We know that images sell products, and beautiful images of tanks and fish for sale will draw customers further into the site. We used high-definition images sourced mainly from Pexels, an excellent free resource.

Bugs
Known Bugs
•	Below 300px screen width the third imgbx returns despite being set to flex 0% and being absent since the last break point at 550px
•	For some reason the fontawesome icons for email and phone will not work while the icon for clock does. Can’t figure out why?
•	On the contact page the dual input checkbox option caused an error where the label ‘for=’ tag could not have 2 ‘id’ tags the same in both input lines so I deleted the id’s for both to cancel the error observed when placed through W3c Schools html validator
Fixed Bugs
•	Built the hover function for contact buttons including a padding value of 5px which cause the div/section to jump every time I hovered over it. Took a while to figure out
•	Incredibly it is not allowed according to the W3C validator to have a tags and button tags used together. Why have a button tag if you can’t link it to a web page? Had to rebuild and reposition a tags instead of buttons which caused a huge delay.
•	From mentor and step up meetings it was clear that certain technologies on the course were obsolete for example ‘float’ and ‘position’, ‘Flex box’ and ‘Grid’ were suggested instead. I have spent 2 weeks nearly 12 hours a day trying to master flex box with any mention of it in the course. Why, I don’t know. Using ‘display’ with ‘block’ or ‘flex’ determined most of my outcomes with ‘block’ in parent div tags stopping the ‘flex’ functionality. ‘flex’ includes 3 properties and figuring out how they worked took most time and ‘bug’ fixes. 
•	Centering the cover text over a fixed background without using position/relative/absolute was littered with bugs that I fixed and it now works
•	Targeting precise elements was very hit and miss until I got the hang of Dev Tools on Chrome. An incredibly useful tool
•	When testing with Google Lighthouse I came across an error where an ifram did not have a title and this effected accessibility. It turned out to be an extension on Chrome –Last Pass- that was adding a ‘div’ with an iframe to the bottom of the page. Just turned the extension off.

Deployment
To deploy the project I followed these steps starting from the main project repository here.
1.	Clicked on Settings on the navigation menu in the repository
2.	I then selected the Pages menu on the side bar.
3.	In the first dropdown menu labelled Source I selected the branch of the name main from the dropdown.
4.	In the next dropdown labelled /root I left as the default option.
5.	Selected Save
I then received a notification from GitHub that my project is being deployed and after about 1 minute & a couple of refreshes of the page it was ready and live.

From the practical use of flex box there is no substitute for watching code translate to substance. Honestly there were too many references to name but I seriously could not have mastered flexbox without them all.
